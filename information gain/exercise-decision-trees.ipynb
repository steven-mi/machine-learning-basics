    "In this exercise you will train and evaluate a decision tree. Opposed to the previous exercises with the topics _univariate linear regression_, _multivariate linear regression_, _logistic regression_ and _bias variance tradeoff_, you will not implement the algorithms from scratch using numpy. Instead you will use two python packages written on top of numpy, namely the _pandas_ and the _scikit-learn_ package, which are both widely used by the machine learning community. The steps can be broken down into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data from a _csv file_ into a pandas DataFrame object\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Train a decision tree and visualize it.\n",
    "4. Do hyperparameter optimization by dividing the dataset into a fixed training set and a fixed validation set.\n",
    "5. Do hyperparameter optimization by crossvalidation\n",

    "In a decision tree the data is split at each node according to a decision rule. This corresponds to nested _if-then-else_-rules. In the _if_-part of such a rule are decison is made based on a feature of the data record. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the scikit learn implementation. For this implementation the features must be binary or have (at least) ordinal characteristic. If a feature is e.g. nominal with many values, it must be converted to a set of binary (one-hot-coded) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The splitting rules in the scikit learn implementation are binary and are based on a threshold, e.g.\n",
    "  - _if $x_6 <= 2.14$ then_ left subbranch, _else_ right subbranch.         \n",
    "  - binary features must be coded as 0/1, so the rule becomes: if $x_2 <= 0.5$ _then_ left subbranch, _else_ right subbranch. \n",

    "<!--The structure of the tree will be determined by data (see below) and a training procedure.-->\n",
